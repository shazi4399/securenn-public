# SecureNN: 3-Party Secure Computation for Neural Network Training

#### Sameer Wagh, Divya Gupta, and Nishanth Chandran

Secure multi-party computation (SMC/MPC) provides a cryptographically secure framework for computations where the privacy of data is a requirement. MPC protocols enable computations over this shared data while providing strong privacy guarantees â€“ the parties only learn output of the computation while learning nothing about the individual inputs. Here we develop a framework for efficient 3-party protocols tailored for state-of-the-art neural networks. SecureNN builds on novel modular arithmetic to implement exact non-linear functions while avoiding the use of interconversion protocols as well as general purpose number theoretic libraries.

We develop and implement efficient protocols for the above set of functionalities. This work is published in [Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS) 2019](https://petsymposium.org/2019/). Paper available [here](http://snwagh.github.io/publications/). Feel free to checkout the follow-up work [Falcon](http://snwagh.github.io/publications/) and it's imporved [implementation](https://github.com/snwagh/falcon-public/).  If you're looking to run Neural Network training, strongly consider using this GPU-based codebase [Piranha](https://github.com/ucbrise/piranha).

### Requirements
---
* The code should work on any Linux distribution of your choice (It has been developed and tested with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) 16.04 and 18.04).

* **Required packages for SecureNN:**
  * [`g++`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/g++)
  * [`make`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/make)
  * [`libssl-dev`](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libssl-dev)

  Install these packages with your favorite package manager, e.g, `sudo apt-get install <package-name>`.


### SecureNN Source Code
---

#### Repository Structure

* `files/`    - Shared keys, IP addresses and data files.
* `lib_eigen/`    - [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for faster matrix multiplication.
* `mnist/`    - Parsing code for converting MNIST data into SecureNN format data.
* `src/`    - Source code for SecureNN.
* `utils/` - Dependencies for AES randomness.

#### Building SecureNN

To build SecureNN, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/snwagh/SecureNN.git
cd SecureNN
make
```

#### Running SecureNN

SecureNN can be run either as a single party (to verify correctness) or as a 3 (or 4) party protocol. It can be run on a single machine (localhost) or over a network. Finally, the output can be written to the terminal or to a file (from Party *P_0*). The makefile contains the promts for each. To run SecureNN, run the appropriate command after building (a few examples given below). 

```
make standalone
make abcTerminal
make abcFile
```



### Additional Resources
---
#### Neural Networks

SecureNN currently supports three types of layers, fully connected, convolutional (without padding), and convolutional layers (with zero padding). The network can be specified in `src/main.cpp`. The core protocols from SecureNN are implemented in `src/Functionalities.cpp`. The code supports both training and testing. 

#### Debugging

A number of debugging friendly functions are implemented in the library. For memory bugs, use [valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org), install using `
sudo apt-get install valgrind`. Then run a single party in debug mode:

```
* Set makefile flags to -g -O0 (instead of -O3)
* make clean; make
* valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --track-origins=yes --dsymutil=yes <executable-file-command>
```

libmiracl.a is compiled locally, if it throws errors, download the source files from [https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL.git](https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL.git) and compile miracl.a yourself and copy into this repo.

Matrix multiplication assembly code only works for Intel C/C++ compiler. Use the non-assembly code from `src/tools.cpp` if needed (might have correctness issues).
